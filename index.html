    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>
      Hi, I'm <strong>Waqas Ibrahim</strong> — a cybersecurity enthusiast who went from flashing phone firmware as a teenager to building enterprise SOC labs. Yes, I was that kid who bricked their phone multiple times and somehow always managed to fix it (eventually).
    </p>

    <h2>How It All Started</h2>
    
    <p>
      My journey into cybersecurity didn't start with a dramatic hacking moment from a movie. It started with curiosity and a lot of broken gadgets.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my younger days, I had a passion for IT that bordered on obsession. I spent hours tinkering with phone firmware, trying to understand how these little computers in our pockets actually worked. I loved breaking things and figuring out how to fix them — a trait that still serves me well in cybersecurity.
    </p>

    <p>
      What really fascinated me was how computers talk to each other. The idea that packets of data could travel across networks, find their destination, and deliver messages felt like magic. I wanted to understand the magic.
    </p>

    <div class="fun-fact">
      <strong>Fun fact:</strong> My first ever program was written in Java. It was probably terrible code, but it worked, and I was hooked.
    </div>

    <h2>The Path to Cybersecurity</h2>

    <p>
      After finishing my computing and engineering studies at <strong>DMUIC</strong>, I had many career paths to choose from. But I kept gravitating toward one question: "How do I break this, and how do I protect it?"
    </p>

    <p>
      That question led me to pursue a <strong>BSc (Hons) in Cyber Security at De Montfort University</strong>, where I graduated with a 2:1. During my degree, I explored various domains — from penetration testing to network security — but I found myself consistently drawn to the defensive side of security.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)</strong> and <strong>Security Operations (SOC)</strong> became my primary interests. There's something deeply satisfying about investigating incidents, analyzing logs, and piecing together what happened during a security event. It's like being a digital detective.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a cybersecurity graduate with hands-on experience across penetration testing, SOC operations, and digital forensics. My focus is on the defensive side — detecting, analyzing, and responding to threats.
    </p>

    <h3>Defensive Security & SOC</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>SOC Analysis & Threat Detection</li>
      <li>Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)</li>
      <li>Security Event Analysis & Log Investigation</li>
      <li>Incident Report Writing & Documentation</li>
      <li>SIEM Configuration & Management (Wazuh)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Offensive Security & Testing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessment</li>
      <li>Web Application Security Testing</li>
      <li>Active Directory & Network Security</li>
      <li>Web and network enumeration using Nmap and Burp Suite</li>
      <li>Identifying SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, IDOR, and authentication vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>CVSS scoring and remediation guidance</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="intro-highlight">
      <strong>My Philosophy:</strong> Understanding how attackers think makes you a better defender. That's why I practice both offensive and defensive security — to see the full picture.
    </div>

    <h2>Continuous Learning & Practice</h2>

    <p>
      Cybersecurity is a field where you never stop learning — and I love that about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I completed the <strong>Junior Penetration Tester</strong> learning path on TryHackMe, which gave me a solid foundation in offensive security techniques. But what really keeps my skills sharp is regular practice on <strong>Hack The Box</strong>. I'm genuinely addicted to their content — every new lab brings a fresh challenge, and there's nothing quite like the feeling of finally getting that root flag at 2 AM.
    </p>

    <h3>Certifications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>TryHackMe Junior Penetration Tester</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Home SOC & Lab Projects</h2>

    <p>
      I don't just read about security — I build it. I actively create realistic enterprise-style labs to understand how security tools work in real environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      My home lab includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Active Directory Domain Controller with domain-joined endpoints</li>
      <li>pfSense firewall for network segmentation and traffic control</li>
      <li>Wazuh SIEM with deployed agents for centralized logging</li>
      <li>Windows and Linux endpoints simulating enterprise environments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This portfolio documents these labs step by step, focusing on architecture, detection workflows, and the lessons I learn along the way. Because the best way to understand SOC operations is to actually build and operate one.
    </p>

    <h2>When I'm Not Hunting Threats...</h2>

    <p>
      Cybersecurity is my full-time passion, but I do occasionally step away from the terminal (shocking, I know).
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm an avid gamer, with a particular love for tactical shooters. You'll often find me playing <strong>Battlefield 4</strong> or <strong>Rainbow Six Siege</strong> — games that, coincidentally, also involve strategy, reconnaissance, and exploiting vulnerabilities. See? Even my hobbies are security-themed.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also love swimming, which gives me time to think through complex problems away from the screen. Some of my best solutions to tricky lab issues have come while doing laps.
    </p>

    <div class="fun-fact">
      <strong>Irony Alert:</strong> I spend my days securing networks, then spend my evenings virtually breaching enemy positions in Rainbow Six Siege. Balance is important.
    </div>

    <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>

    <p>
      I'm eager to start my career as a <strong>Junior SOC Analyst</strong> or <strong>Junior DFIR Analyst</strong>. I want to work in an environment where I can:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Investigate real security incidents and learn from experienced analysts</li>
      <li>Contribute to threat detection and incident response workflows</li>
      <li>Continue developing my skills in a fast-paced, challenging environment</li>
      <li>Work with a team that values curiosity and continuous learning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I'm a continuous learner who's always looking to expand my knowledge and take on new challenges. If you're looking for someone who's genuinely passionate about security, builds labs for fun, and won't rest until they've figured out why that alert fired at 3 AM — let's talk.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>BSc (Hons) Cyber Security</strong> — De Montfort University (2:1)</li>
      <li><strong>Computing and Engineering Studies</strong> — DMUIC</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What This Portfolio Is About</h2>
    
    <p>
      This site is a learning journal where I document hands-on security work, SOC investigations, and blue-team focused labs. It's a place to share what I'm learning, showcase my projects, and demonstrate my approach to cybersecurity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every lab, every challenge, and every write-up here represents hours of learning, troubleshooting, and occasionally breaking things (then fixing them). Because that's what cybersecurity is all about.
