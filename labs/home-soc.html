    <h1>Implementing a Realistic Home SOC Lab</h1>

    <p>
      This walkthrough documents the implementation of a realistic Home SOC lab
      designed to simulate an enterprise network from a Blue Team / SOC analyst
      perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of this lab was not just to install tools, but to understand how
      logs flow across an enterprise environment and how SOC analysts detect,
      triage, and investigate security events.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives of the Lab</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Simulate an enterprise Active Directory environment</li>
      <li>Centralize logs using a SIEM</li>
      <li>Monitor endpoints and servers</li>
      <li>Understand SOC Level 1 investigation workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>High-Level Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The lab simulates a small enterprise network consisting of:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>pfSense Firewall (Gateway & perimeter security)</li>
      <li>Active Directory Domain Controller (DC01)</li>
      <li>Windows endpoint (HR-PC01)</li>
      <li>Ubuntu Server running Wazuh SIEM</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All systems communicate within a private internal network.
    </p>

    <h2>Network Design & IP Addressing</h2>
    <p>
      I used the private subnet <strong>192.168.10.0/24</strong>, which is commonly
      found in enterprise environments and supports up to 254 hosts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Domain Controller also acts as the DNS server, which reflects a typical
      Windows enterprise setup.
    </p>

    <h2>Active Directory Setup</h2>
    <p>
      I deployed Active Directory using the internal domain
      <strong>threatwatch.local</strong>. This non-routable domain is safe for labs
      and documentation and cannot be discovered externally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Active Directory manages centralized authentication and identity for all
      domain-joined systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Firewall & Routing (pfSense)</h2>
    <p>
      pfSense serves as the default gateway for all systems, providing NAT,
      routing, and network visibility. This helped me understand north-south
      traffic flow and the firewall’s role in a SOC environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Wazuh SIEM Deployment</h2>
    <p>
      Wazuh was deployed on an Ubuntu Server to centralize logs from endpoints
      and servers. It provides visibility into authentication events, system
      activity, and security alerts.
    </p>

    <p><em>[Screenshot: Wazuh Dashboard Overview]</em></p>

    <h2>Agent Deployment & Enrollment</h2>
    <p>
      Wazuh agents were installed and authenticated on both the Domain Controller
      and the Windows endpoint. This step demonstrated how endpoint telemetry is
      securely forwarded to a SIEM.
    </p>

    <p><em>[Screenshot: Wazuh Agent Status]</em></p>

    <h2>Security Events & SOC Visibility</h2>
    <p>
      Once fully integrated, login events, authentication failures, and system
      activity became visible in the SIEM. This enabled basic alert triage and
      investigation workflows.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Lab Taught Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How logs flow across an enterprise network</li>
      <li>The importance of centralized monitoring</li>
      <li>How SOC analysts investigate alerts</li>
      <li>Common configuration and troubleshooting challenges</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Future improvements include Sysmon integration, attack simulation,
      MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and alert tuning to reduce noise.
